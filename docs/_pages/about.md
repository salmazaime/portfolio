## Cybersecurity Focus: Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è | Blue Team üõ° | AI üîê

Hello! I'm **Salma Zaime**, a passionate and beginner-friendly cybersecurity student focused on high-impact areas of modern security.

I believe in **learning by doing**. My portfolio showcases practical labs and projects focused on understanding how to build, secure, and defend modern digital environments.

### Blue Team Detection Engineering
I am actively developing skills in **threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring**. My goal is to become proficient in creating robust security controls and implementing detection logic to catch adversaries early.

### Cloud Security (AWS/Azure)
The future is in the cloud. My work focuses on **Securing IaaS/PaaS/SaaS environments**, understanding cloud-native security tools, and ensuring compliance and least-privilege principles are applied across major cloud providers.

### AI for Cybersecurity
I am exploring the application of **Machine Learning models** for tasks like anomaly detection, malware analysis, and automating security operations (SecOps). This field is the next frontier of defense, and I'm excited to be building practical skills here.

### My Approach to Learning

I document my work publicly on GitHub, treating every lab, capture-the-flag (CTF) challenge, and personal project as a piece of my education. I'm always eager to collaborate and discuss new ideas in security!
